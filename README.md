# SDCard-WhiteSpace-BMPLoader
SD Cards don't use 4096KiB - so I created a program to save 8-bit BMPs and load them in MCGA mode on bootup without an operating system
these should be put on a FAT32 compatible disk image, booted with a legacy bios.  The program works on a legacy boot from SD after it's run.
